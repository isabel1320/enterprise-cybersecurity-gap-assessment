Enterprise cybersecurity gap assessment aligning security controls with PCI DSS, GDPR, and NIST frameworks, including incident response and business continuity planning.
# SAGE Books – Enterprise Cybersecurity Gap Assessment & Response Plan

**Role Simulated:** Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)  
**Project Type:** Enterprise Security Assessment & Compliance Alignment  
**Focus Areas:** PCI DSS v4.0, GDPR, NIST Frameworks, Incident Response, Business Continuity  

---

## Project Overview

SAGE Books underwent an independent security assessment that identified significant gaps in governance, compliance alignment, staffing, incident response, and business continuity planning.

This project documents:

- Identified security deficiencies
- Regulatory misalignment (PCI DSS & GDPR)
- Recommended mitigation strategies
- Workforce role mapping (NICE Framework)
- Incident Response and Business Continuity improvements

The objective was to design a structured remediation plan aligned with recognized industry standards and enterprise security best practices.
**Note:** This project is based on an academic case study.

## Identified Security Gaps

| Category | Gap Identified | Risk Impact | Framework Reference |
|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| Security Policies | No formal policies for acceptable use, mobile devices, passwords, or PII protection | Increased likelihood of data breach | NIST, PCI DSS, GDPR |
| PCI DSS Compliance | No defined cardholder data (CHD) handling procedures | Financial penalties, cardholder data exposure | PCI DSS v4.0 |
| GDPR Compliance | No structured EU data protection processes | Regulatory fines, reputational damage | GDPR Articles 5–23 |
| GRC Staffing | No dedicated compliance or risk oversight roles | Limited governance visibility | NICE Framework |
| Security Awareness | Ad hoc training with low participation | Phishing and social engineering risk | NIST SP 800-50 |
| Incident Response | Incomplete IRP with undefined roles and procedures | Delayed detection and containment | NIST SP 800-61r2 |
| Business Continuity | No disaster recovery strategy for distribution centers | Operational downtime and revenue loss | NIST / ISO 22301 |

## Mitigation Strategy Overview

### 1. Governance & Policy Development
- Develop comprehensive security policies
- Align controls with PCI DSS v4.0 and GDPR
- Formalize Acceptable Use, Mobile Device, Password, and PII policies

### 2. Regulatory Compliance Alignment
- Establish secure CHD storage, processing, and transmission procedures
- Implement GDPR data subject rights processes
- Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)

### 3. Security Workforce Expansion
- Add Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Analyst
- Add Security Controls Assessor
- Formalize compliance oversight functions

### 4. Incident Response Redesign
Aligned with **NIST SP 800-61r2**:

- Preparation
- Detection & Analysis
- Containment, Eradication & Recovery
- Post-Incident Lessons Learned

### 5. Business Continuity Enhancement
- Conduct Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Develop alternate recovery sites
- Implement semi-annual disaster recovery testing
